# The Pursuit of Happiness!

## Project Statement: 
Why this topic? Since most of us spend a great deal of our lives working, it is inevitable that holidays play a key role in shaping our levels of happiness. Subjective wellbeing – often loosely referred to as happiness – can be measured along multiple dimensions, but here I am focussing on the affect of holidays on a country's happiness. By looking at the data, I realized that countries that rank high in terms of productivity are more happier. So, it would be really interesting to monitor these factors and analyzing the reasons behind a high or low happiness score.

For the analysis, I pulled data about the happiness score, productivity score, public and paid holidays for each country from multiple data sources listed below: <br />

## Original Visualization:

### Critique for the Visualization:
* The author has made the claim that "More holidays does not mean more happiness" and by holidays he means public holidays, he did not consider the paid vacations in a country.
* The dashboard looks crowded due to adding lots of countries together, and it becomes hard to read the data through visualization.
* The trend line is not informational.


### Goal for the Deceptive Visualization:
The author has made a claim that "More holidays does not mean more happiness", and holidays here are public holidays. So, I will be developing a deceptive version of it showing "More holidays mean more happiness" and for holidays I will be using data about number of paid vacations allowed in each country. Also, I will be showing how productivity and happiness of a country are related to each other.
Since, the data covers all the countries, it would be hard to display the changing metrics for each and every country. For simplification, I will be segregating the countries based on their advancement as Developed and Developing countries.

### Audience:
The audience for my visualization would be government of countries with low happiness score, so that they can enable policies that support better lives and improve on happiness score. May be they can reframe their holiday grants to improve on happiness score because happiness is considered to be a better indicator of human welfare than do income, poverty, education, health and good government measured separately. 

#### Audience Need:
Being a government of any country, you have to have a good happiness score to survive because if your country people are not happy that is a red flag for you. Since, most of a country's population works, holidays become an integral part of their happiness quotient. So, in order to make their citizens happy, government might consider to change their holiday grants per year. 

#### Audience Want:
Though every government would want their citizens to be happy by granting good number of public and paid holidays, at the same time the employers would not be happy with that. So, even if they want to reframe holiday policies, there will be some oppositions.

#### Audience Fears:
* A government would fear unhappy country people
* A low productivity score
