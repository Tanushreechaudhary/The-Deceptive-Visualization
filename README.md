# The Pursuit of Happiness!

## Project Statement: 
Why this topic? Since most of us spend a great deal of our lives working, it is inevitable that holidays play a key role in shaping our levels of happiness. Subjective wellbeing – often loosely referred to as happiness – can be measured along multiple dimensions, but here I am focussing on the affect of holidays on a country's happiness. By looking at the data, I realized that countries that rank high in terms of productivity are more happier. So, it would be really interesting to monitor these factors and analyzing the reasons behind a high or low happiness score.

For the analysis, I pulled data about the happiness score, productivity score, public and paid holidays for each country from multiple data sources listed below: <br />

## Original Visualization:

### Critique for the Visualization:
* The trend line is not informational
* The dashboard looks crowded due to adding lots of countries together
* The author has not made a clear claim how happiness changes with public holidays

### My Goal:
* The original visualization just shows how public holidays and happiness are related but there is no actual claim made
* Taking into view the original visualization, I will be making a claim and then developing a deceptive version of it
* Will be dividing countries based on their advancement, Developed and Developing
* Will be adding data about paid vacations and productivity scores for a particular country

### Audience:
The audience for my visualization would be government of all the countries, so that they can enable policies that support better lives. May be they can reframe their holiday grants to improve on happiness score. Happiness is considered to be a better indicator of human welfare than do income, poverty, education, health and good government measured separately.
